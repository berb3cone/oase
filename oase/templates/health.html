  <h1> Treatment and result evaluation </h1>
    <div class="indent">
      The Health section is meant to help a nutritionist to better understand the results of weight loosing plans on
      all his patients. Each person folow a particular treatment - with 2 main components: diet and workout.
    </div>
    <div class="indent">
      For diet we have 3 options: low fat, low carbohydrates and a composed diet with both low fat and carbs. The workouts can
      be once/week, twice/week or more.
    </div>
    <div class="indent">
      The effects are measured in 2 stages, after 1 month and 3 months. To be able to interpret correctly the results
      and to evaluate better future patients, the nutritionist has to consider the age and the gender of each person,
      together with the prescribed treatment (diet + workout). Considering the nature of his occupation, the nutritionist
      cannot refuse patients because of age or gender - and being exposed to all categories of persons might confuse him -
      because we all know that each person is different and has different needs.
    </div>
    <div class="indent">
      The graphs generated by OASE are meant to give the nutritionist a clear statistic of what worked and what
      didn't, and all of this concentrated in dashboards that are at 1 click distance - so he/she doesn't need to
      search his notes or remember every single treatment.
