About OASE

The name of the project is an abbreviation for “Online Analytics Services Example”. OASE is a web application that I’ve developed in python, css and html, and it’s based on Django web framework. It uses an SQLite database.

This first release contains functionalities for 2 roles: a loan expert and a nutritionist. While in general loan experts are working in banks or consulting companies, the nutritionists are small entrepreneurs who don't have an IT team behind and generally operate without digital tools, but based on their experience. The first step in using OASE is to populate the database through the web interface; to gain competitive advantage from this data, special graphs are generated in the "Dashboard" sections.

In order to start the project:
- in console (powershell) navigate in the oase directory
- run this command: python .\manage.py runserver
- open a web browser
- open this address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- use the user 'alex' and password 'alex'
